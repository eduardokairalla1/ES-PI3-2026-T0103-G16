## About

MesclaInvest is a mobile platform for **simulated startup investment** linked to the Mescla innovation ecosystem at PUC-Campinas.

Users can browse registered startups, consult corporate information, and participate in a **simulated token trading desk** representing ownership stakes in innovative projects. All financial operations are fully simulated — no real assets or external financial systems are involved.

### Key features

- **Authentication** — registration with email, CPF and phone number; password recovery; optional multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- **Startup catalog** — listing with filters by stage (New, Operating, Expanding), detailed profile with executive summary, ownership structure and public documents
- **Token trading desk** — simulated buy and sell of tokens between registered users, with a fictional BRL digital wallet
- **Value dashboard** — graphical tracking of token value changes over daily, weekly, monthly, last 6 months and YTD periods
- **Q&A with founders** — public or private questions (investors only)
